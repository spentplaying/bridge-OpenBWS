Opening Lead
============

Trump Contract
--------------



No Trump Contract
-----------------



High level Contract
-------------------
#### Design
- Lead A ask for encourage
- Lead K ask for count

#### Description
When defensing a high level (over 5) contract, 
we need to cash AK if possible and distinguish the suit count.
So when we lead with A, partner must tell us he has K or not.
If lead with K, partner must tell us the count so we can decide to cash out or switch.
